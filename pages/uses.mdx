# Uses

Inspired by Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech), I have put together a list of my current setup.

## Applications

### Text Editor

My daily driver is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Not only do I use VS Code for code, but I also write pretty much everything else in there. In comparison to word processors such as [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/en-us/word), VS Code doesn't allow you to format text as such, which means I have one less opportunity to procrastinate on whatever I am writing.

VS Code also has an amazing ecosystem of extensions. Those I use are listed in my [Mac Setup](/mac-setup) process.

### Browser

My main browser is the MacOS default browser, [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/). Despite its bad reputation, it is good looking and works well with Apple Keychain, so there is no need to use a 3rd party password manager.

During development, I also test on [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Web Services

### Code Hosting, etc.

I host all of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com). All of my code repositories are public. I also use private GitHub repositories as a backup for some of my personal stuff, such as essays, etc.

### Deployment

All of my web-based projects are deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Being the creators and maintainers of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), their platform is specifically designed to host Next.js applications, but they also support vanilla web hosting, other frameworks and even other languages. They also offer a [generous free tier](https://vercel.com/pricing), which is an added bonus.

## Command Line Stuff

### Terminal

I use the default MacOS Terminal. Many people use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com), but I prefer the default terminal. MacOS ships with it, and it serves its purpose. End of story.

### Shell

My default shell is the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com). The syntax highlighting is nice, and the inbuilt autocompletion is a killer feature. Fish also comes with a few other small improvements, such as mapping `..` to `cd ..`.

### Shell Prompt

As a shell prompt, I use [Starship](https://starship.rs). It's cool because it shows information relevant to the directory one is currently in, such as git status, npm version, and the time the last command took to execute. Starship is a cross-shell prompt, so it integrates smoothly with fish.

### Package Manager

I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), the go-to package manager for MacOS.

## Fonts

### Fira Code

For code, I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) because of the awesome ligatures it ships with. I have it enabled in both VS Code and the default MacOS terminal.

### Inter

I have started using [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for its clean look and feel. I came across it because [Vercel](https://vercel.com) uses it for their interfaces and I really enjoy [their designs](https://vercel.com/design). I am also using Inter on the third generation of my personal website.
