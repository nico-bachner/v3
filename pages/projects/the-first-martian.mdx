# The First Martian

The First Martian is an Indie Space Exploration Game. It is a team project created for the 2019 Luxembourg Tech School Game Development Competition. Our team received the 1st prize for our game.

## About the Game

The game is similar to _Thrust_, a 1986 video game. The objective is to navigate a spaceship from the launch platform to the landing platform. The first level starts out simple, with only one rock to navigate around.

As the levels progress, there are increasing amounts of obstacles to be avoided.
The spaceship also has a limited fuel supply. Therefore, the player needs to collect fuel tanks along their way.

Even if the player succeeds in completing all six levels, they may still incur a total loss in funds if the lives of too many astronauts are lost. In order to win the game, all six levels must be completed without a single loss of life.

If too many lives are lost, then you lose.
