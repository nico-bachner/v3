# SOS School

SOS School ia a student initiative with the goal of helping primary school children in Luxembourg in their scholarly endeavours following the COVID-19 lockdowns.

Being a co-founder of the initiative, I took on multiple roles and responsabilities within the project:

-   [Organiser](#organiser)
-   [Volunteer](#volunteer)
-   [Webmaster](#webmaster)

## Organiser

## Volunteer

## Webmaster

Being the only code literate person in our team, it was my responsability to create and maintain the project homepage, [www.sos-school.org](https://www.sos-school.org).

As I was still relatively new to Web Development at the beginning of the project, I spent a lot of time experimenting in order to see what works. Once I started gaining experience, I was able to make better decisions, which often led to me taking two steps back and completely rethinking the architecture of the site.

After countless iterations, I have arrived at something that I feel fulfills the requirements of the site. The final tech stack is [React](https://reactjs.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com), and it leverages Next.js' inbuilt [internationalised routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) to make the page accessible to the panoply of ethnicities of the People of Luxembourg.

The source code for the site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sos-school/sos-school).
