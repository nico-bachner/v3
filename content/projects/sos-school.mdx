SOS School ia a student initiative with the goal of helping primary school children in Luxembourg in their scholarly endeavors following the COVID-19 lockdowns.

## Website

In addition to co-mananging the project, I was responsible for creating the [Website](https://www.sos-school.org).

Since Luxembourg is a very multilingual country, I had to find a way to explain the project to everyone. The solution I went with in the end was leveraging the excellent [Next.js internationalised routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing). This allows me to serve the appropriate translation of our project information to each visitor of the page.

## Source Code

The source code for the site can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sos-school/sos-school).
