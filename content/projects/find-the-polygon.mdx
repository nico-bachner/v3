# Find The Polygon

Find the Polygon is a browser game that teaches about different spatial dimensions through interaction with cross-sections of objects. I created it in the context of the 2020 Luxembourg Tech School Game Development Challenge, in which the game received the 10th place.

## About the Game

The aim of the game is to discover various 2D polygons hidden in cross-sections of 3D polyhedra. To achieve this, one must rotate and displace each polyhedron so that it fits the final cross-section.

## Demo

Feel free to give [the game](https://ftp.nicob.dev) a try. I have compiled it to WebGL, meaning it can run in your browser.

## Source Code

The compiled WebGL source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nico-bachner/find-the-polygon). Sadly, I have lost the original source code.
