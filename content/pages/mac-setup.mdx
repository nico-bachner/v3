# Mac Setup

A script to set up most of what I need installed and changed on my Mac during a clean (re)install.

**Disclaimer:** This script is optimised for my personal preferences. If you should want to use it, I strongly encourage you to [read the script](https://github.com/nico-bachner/mac-setup/blob/main/index.sh) and edit it to your liking.

## Instructions

In the command line, run:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nico-bachner/mac-setup/main/index.sh | sh
```

Enjoy!
