Make® Conversations is a web-based project I worked on at Make, a creative agency based in Copenhagen.

It was my first time working at a company, and I learned a great deal from the experience. Make was stuck on a legacy system, so I decided to develop the new site with the modern tooling I was experienced with at the time. Looking back on this decision, however, I realise my attempt to port their existing setup to modern infrastructure was premature, as the disparity between the different configurations resulted in more problems then simply sticking with the existing setup.
